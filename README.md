## Introduction

Adventure Awaits is a camping and hiking wear online store.
The website is designed for the business purpose of selling clothing and equipment suited for camping and hiking trips.
This is my fullstack milestone project at code institute. The goal of this project is to build a website that uses HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Django, Stripe and a relational database.
This project is deployed on Heroku and styled using bootstrap and css.
To test the functionality of the payment section of this project use the card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 or 4000 0027 6000 3184 with any CVC and expiry date.
